## Description

The project involves analyzing population data for the United States spanning from 2013 to 2021. Utilizing the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year Estimate dataset provided by the US Census Bureau, population figures were gathered annually. The dataset includes population counts for each year, allowing for an insightful examination of demographic trends over time. Through meticulous analysis, trends such as population growth rates, changes in population distribution across different regions, and potential demographic shifts were identified. This comprehensive dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and analysts seeking to understand the dynamics of the US population and its implications for various socio-economic factors. Additionally, the project underscores the importance of reliable and up-to-date demographic data in informing evidence-based decision-making processes at local, state, and national levels.



The project leverages data retrieved from the public API provided by datausa.io to analyze population trends in the United States. By accessing this API, the project accesses comprehensive population data categorized by nation, allowing for in-depth exploration of demographic shifts over time. Specifically, the project focuses on utilizing the API's capabilities to drill down into national-level data and extract population measures. Through this approach, the project aims to gain insights into population dynamics, including growth patterns, demographic composition, and regional variations. By harnessing the power of publicly available data through the API, the project facilitates informed decision-making and fosters a deeper understanding of the socio-economic landscape of the United States. Moreover, the accessibility of the API empowers researchers, policymakers, and analysts to conduct their own analyses and investigations into population-related phenomena, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping society.
